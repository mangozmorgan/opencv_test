# 🌟 opencv_test
First test with OpenCV in C++ 🚀

## Compilation

To compile your code with OpenCV, run the following command:

```powershell
g++ -o main main.cpp -I C:/opencv-4.11.0/build/install/include -L C:/opencv-4.11.0/build/install/x64/mingw/lib -lopencv_core4110 -lopencv_highgui4110 -lopencv_imgcodecs4110 -lopencv_videoio4110 -lopencv_imgproc4110
```
## Test It Out! 🎯
Run main.exe, and you should see a green rectangle surrounding a circle. ✅

Enjoy your first OpenCV test in C++! 🎉
